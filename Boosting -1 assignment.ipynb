    "Boosting is an ensemble learning technique in machine learning that combines the predictions of multiple weak learners to create a strong learner. The primary goal of boosting is to improve the accuracy and performance of a model by sequentially training weak models, where each model corrects the errors of its predecessor. \n",

    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved Accuracy: Boosting often results in higher accuracy compared to individual weak learners.\n",
    "Handles Complex Relationships: Boosting can capture complex relationships in the data, making it suitable for a wide range of tasks.\n",
    "Reduced Overfitting: It tends to reduce overfitting by focusing on correcting errors and adapting to the underlying patterns in the data.\n",
    "Versatility: Boosting can be applied to various types of weak learners and is not limited to a specific algorithm.\n",
    "Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensitivity to Noisy Data: Boosting can be sensitive to noisy data and outliers, as it tries to fit the training data very closely.\n",
    "Computationally Intensive: Training multiple weak learners sequentially can be computationally expensive and time-consuming.\n",
    "Requires Tuning: Boosting algorithms often have several hyperparameters that need to be tuned for optimal performance."
